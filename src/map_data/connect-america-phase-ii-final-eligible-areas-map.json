Specifically, the map identifies areas determined by a cost model as eligible for support and which are served by a class of larger carriers called price cap carriers. These areas are shown in bright green on the map. The map displays the outputs of the final version of the Connect America Cost Model (CAM) (version 4.3) adopted for purposes of making the offer Phase II support to price cap carriers. The model calculates costs per location in all price cap carrier census blocks for the entire country. Empty areas with no color are either located in areas served by another class of carriers, called rate-of-return carriers, which are not eligible for the offer of model-based support from the Connect America Fund, but may receive support from other universal service high-cost mechanisms, and/or are reported as uninhabited.</p><p>The offer of model-based support is targeted to price cap areas that are high-cost, but not extremely high-cost. Areas on the map fall into one of five categories: eligible, ineligible because the average cost is above the extremely high-cost threshold (EHCT), ineligible because the average cost is below the funding benchmark, high-cost areas that are ineligible for other reasons, and areas not subject to the offer of support because the carrier in the area is not interested in model-based support. An area is classified as “eligible” if the average monthly cost-per-location for that census block, as calculated by the cost model, is above the $52.50 funding benchmark but below the $198.60 EHCT, and is not served by an unsubsidized competitor, subsidized wireline competitor, or was not subject to specific types of bids in the rural broadband experiments. An area is classified as “other ineligible” if the average monthly cost-per-location is above $52.50 but below $198.60, but it is served by an unsubsidized competitor, a subsidized wireline competitor, or was removed from the offer to price cap carriers due to the rural broadband experiments. Price cap areas in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are classified as “elected frozen” because the carriers serving these non-contiguous areas indicated that they are interested in receiving frozen Phase II support in lieu of model-based support.</p><p>When the map is zoomed in to display county boundaries, clicking on an area of the map displays additional information for that particular county. The county information provides the county name, the total number of price cap locations in the county, the total number of price cap locations that are eligible for model-based support, and the cost model-derived amount of annual Phase II support available in the county. Carriers accepting support will be required to offer broadband service to a specific number of locations across their entire service area in the state. Note that not all locations in a given county are eligible for Phase II support.</p><p>For more information about Connect America Phase II, refer to <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/price-cap-resources\">https://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/price-cap-resources</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/maps/fcc-connect-america-phase-ii-final-eligible-areas-map\">Click here for the original version of this map</a>.</p>",
