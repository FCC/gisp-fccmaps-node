Counties that contain any of these blocks are shaded light gray, and as you zoom in and mouse over these counties you will see more information on the eligible blocks, including population, road miles (S1100, S1200, S1400, S1500, S1640, and S1740 categories), and the name and number of the CMA in which the blocks are located.
